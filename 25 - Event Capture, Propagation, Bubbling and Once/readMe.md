## Description

This exercise shows how bubbling occurs...when you click on nested elements it ripples up to the highest level element.

You can pass the key value pair capture true to the addEventListener to print the capture sequence as opposed to the bubble up. 

e.stopPropagation() can stop the bubbling process

-> the once option unbinds after 1 occurence..in this case a click.
